This is a collection of scripts which should be
helpful to perform load testing on MarkUs.

The order in which these scripts should be run is
as follows:

  1. run-load-tests.sh (which uses post_submissions.sh)
  2. run-load-tests.sh -c (which collects results from clients)
  3. log_file_analyzer.sh (which uses request_time_analyzer.rb)
